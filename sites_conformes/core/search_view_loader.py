"""Mechanism for fork apps to plug a custom search results view into ``/search/``.

How to add a custom search view
===============================

Fork projects can replace the default search page with their own view and
template without editing ``sites_conformes``.

1. Create a Django app outside ``sites_conformes/``, or add the view to an
   existing app (see ``faceted_search/`` in https://github.com/betagouv/agreste
   for a full example).

2. Implement a search results view. It should be a Django ``View`` subclass
   with an ``as_view()`` class method. It completely replaces
   :class:`~sites_conformes.core.views.SearchResultsView`, so it must implement
   the full search behaviour itself (queryset, template context, etc.).

3. Set the ``SEARCH_VIEW`` Django setting to the dotted path of your view
   class::

       SEARCH_VIEW = "my_search.views.MySearchResultsView"

4. Add the app to ``INSTALLED_APPS``. The ``/search/`` URL is already wired in
   ``sites_conformes.core.urls``; no URL changes are required.

Only one view can be configured. If ``SEARCH_VIEW`` is not set, the default
``sites_conformes.core.views.SearchResultsView`` is used.
